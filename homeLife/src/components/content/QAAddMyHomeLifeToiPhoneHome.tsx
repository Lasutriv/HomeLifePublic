            <p>1. Open the Safari app and navigate to www.myhomelife.com</p>
            <p>2. Tap the Share button on the browser’s toolbar — that’s the rectangle with an arrow pointing upward. It’s on the bar at the top of the screen on an iPad, and on the bar at the bottom of the screen on an iPhone or iPod Touch.</p>
            <p>3. Tap the Add to Home Screen icon in the Share menu. You may have to scroll left/right on the iPad or up/down on the iPhone in order to see the icon.</p>
            <p>4. You’ll be prompted to name the shortcut before tapping the Add button. The shortcut can be dragged around and placed anywhere, including in app folders — just like a normal app icon. When you tap the icon, it will load the website in a normal tab inside the Safari browser app but removing the Safari UI.</p>
